description: Exercise the real app/API/CLI and collect observable evidence; tests alone do not count as end-to-end verification.

# Verify


## When to use

Use when the user wants proof the real surface works, not only unit tests.


## Non-goals

- Unit tests alone are not end-to-end verification.

- Do not fake success without observable evidence.


## Workflow

1. Identify the real entrypoint (CLI binary, API, UI).

2. Exercise it with realistic inputs.

3. Capture outputs, exit codes, logs, or screenshots.

4. Report evidence and remaining uncertainty.
