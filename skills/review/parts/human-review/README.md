# Human Review

Edit HTML and Markdown files directly, leave comments like a Google Doc, and send all your feedback to your AI agent at once.

## Problem

Giving AI feedback on files in chat is painful.

Sometimes you want to change one sentence yourself. Instead, you end up typing:

> In the third paragraph, change X to Y. Cut the third card because it repeats the first one. Also rewrite the CTA.

Then the agent changes the file and you have to check whether it understood every instruction. This gets even harder when you’re reviewing a long plan, Markdown document, landing page, or multi-page website.

## How to install /human-review

The easiest way to install the skill is to paste this into ChatGPT, Claude Code, Codex, or your favorite coding agent:

```text
Install the /human-review skill globally from https://github.com/petergyang/human-review
```

You can also install it with `npx`:

```sh
npx -y human-review setup --global
```

## How to use /human-review

![Human Review visual editor](assets/human-review.png)

Open an HTML or Markdown file:

```text
/human-review (your file)
```

Review a page running on localhost:

```text
/human-review (localhost URL)
```

Human Review opens the file in your browser. Make direct edits, leave comments, and click Send. Your agent receives all your feedback in one batch, updates the source, and refreshes the page for another review.

Note: For HTML files, direct edits and resizes save automatically. For Markdown and localhost pages, click Send so your agent can apply them to the source.

## What this skill lets you do

- **Edit text directly and tweak basic formatting** (e.g., bold, italic).
- **Make bulleted and numbered lists** — type `- ` or `1. ` at the start of a line, or press ⌘⇧8 / ⌘⇧7. Tab and Shift+Tab indent and outdent.
- **Add links** — select text and press ⌘K. ⌘K inside an existing link edits or removes it.
- **Resize images** by dragging their corner, and **move images** by dragging them to a new spot.
- **Rearrange the page** — hover any block and drag the handle on its left edge to move the whole block somewhere else.
- **Paste images** from your clipboard — they're saved into an `assets/` folder next to the file and inserted at your cursor.
- **Select a phrase and leave a comment** anchored to the exact text.
- **Comment on an image, chart, or section** by clicking the element.
- **Remove elements** without explaining the deletion in chat.
- **Command-click links** to review multiple pages without losing your feedback.
- **Send every edit and comment at once** instead of writing a long chat message.

I use Human Review to edit AI-generated plans, update landing pages, review localhost apps, and remove the extra copy AI likes to add to UX.

## What’s inside

- [`cli.js`](src/cli.js) contains the `human-review`, `poll`, `status`, and `setup` commands.
- [`server.js`](src/server.js) runs the local review session.
- [`sdk.js`](src/sdk.js) handles editing, comments, highlights, and feedback.
- [`chrome-client.js`](src/chrome-client.js) contains the visual review interface.
- [`markdown.js`](src/markdown.js) renders Markdown files for review.
- [`SKILL.md`](src/SKILL.md) teaches Claude Code, Codex, and other agents how to use Human Review.

Everything runs on your computer. Human Review doesn’t require an account, cloud service, database, or API key.
