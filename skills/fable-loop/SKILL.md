name: fable-loop
description: End-to-end workflow that describes the way Fable ran sessions - parallel evidence subagents when the host supports them, one committed plan, surgical execution with an intent gate, adversarial verification, honest outcome-first report. Use for non-trivial multi-step tasks when the user says "/fable-loop", "run the fable loop", or "do this the way Fable would". For the rules alone without orchestration, use fable-method; for the plain task cycle without subagents, use task-cycle; for large multi-phase projects, prefer the GSD workflow and use this inside phases.

# The Fable Loop

This skill describes an orchestration workflow around fable-method: read its SKILL.md first; its rules govern every stage. The method says WHAT to check; this loop describes WHO may do the work when the host exposes subagent support. In hosts without that capability, run the same evidence and adversarial checks inline; do not claim that subagents were spawned.

**Gate first.** Trivial per the method's triviality gate: just do it, verify with the one obvious check, report in two sentences. No stages, no subagents. Everything else runs the four stages below in order.

## Stage 1 - PLAN (the first bookend)

1. Apply method Steps 0-3: classify the ask, define done with a named verification, state load-bearing assumptions.
2. **Evidence fan-out.** If the host exposes a verified subagent facility, spawn evidence gatherers as parallel subagents in ONE message, never sequentially. Otherwise perform the same independent lookups inline/batched and record the fallback; never imply a spawn occurred:
   - codebase questions: an Explore agent per distinct area ("how does X work", "what depends on Y");
   - library or fact questions: a research agent that fetches current docs or searches the web;
   - each subagent returns distilled findings with citations, never raw file dumps.
   One batch plus one follow-up batch is the budget; a third needs a stated reason.
3. **Produce the plan artifact** in this shape: classification; definition of done plus its verification; evidence found (cited); ONE recommended approach (alternatives dismissed in a line each); the scope (the exact files or surfaces the work will touch); risks and assumptions; and the execution checklist.
4. **Decision gate.** Task-shaped and reversible: proceed to Stage 2 without asking. Plan-first shape (ambiguous scope, irreversible or outward-facing actions, or the user asked for a plan): present the plan artifact and STOP for approval.


## Stage 2 - EXECUTE

1. Work the checklist in the **main thread** (use the todo tool if the harness has one; tick items as they complete). Deciding and editing stay in the main thread; only searching and verifying fan out.
2. Every edit follows method Step 4: intent gate before behavior changes, recall gate before first use of anything unopened, smallest correct change, precise edits, never destroy without looking.
3. Independent mechanical items (same change across many files, isolated file generation) may fan out to parallel subagents, in one message, with worktree isolation if they could touch the same files.
4. A surprise mid-execution re-routes per method Step 2 rule 7: say it, then update the plan or go back to Stage 1. Never force the plan through a surprise.
5. Mid-item ignorance is a pause, not a guess: the moment an edit would carry a fact from memory (a signature, a key, a figure), stop that item, fan out one research subagent per the method's recall gate, and resume when it returns.
6. Outward-facing checklist items obey the method's authorization gate: no quoted user authorization, no action; the item converts to a proposed next step in the report.

## Stage 3 - VERIFY (adversarially)

1. Run the named verification yourself, both halves: the done criterion observed (ran, rendered, counted), and the surrounding system still healthy (build, tests, lint for the touched area).
2. **For consequential changes, use adversarial checks.** If verified subagent support exists, spawn 1-3 parallel attackers; otherwise run distinct refutation checks inline. Example prompts/lenses: "Read this diff and prove the change is wrong or incomplete", "Exercise the changed behavior at runtime and find an input that breaks it", "Check this claim against the spec/docs and find a contradiction", "Diff the full change set against the plan's declared scope and prove something outside it changed". Distinct lenses beat identical reviewers.
3. A finding that survives your own check goes back to Stage 2 as new work. Hard bound per the method: 3 failed fix-verify cycles on the same issue, or any blocker outside your control, means stop and hand back with the output and your hypothesis.

## Stage 4 - AUDIT and REPORT (the second bookend)

1. Self-audit per fable-method audit mode: for each method step, followed, skipped, or faked. Fix what one pass can fix (usually an unverified claim: verify it now or relabel it a caveat).
2. Deliver per method Step 6: outcome in the first sentence, verification evidence shown, honest caveats, follow-ups only if they emerged from the work. No stage names or step numbers in the report; the INTENT and AUTH lines are the only method artifacts a report may contain.

## When NOT to use this loop

- Trivial tasks (the gate handles them).
- Pure questions with no multi-step work: plain fable-method covers the shape.
- Inside an already-orchestrated GSD phase: GSD owns the stages there; apply fable-method rules within them instead of nesting loops.

## Model economy

The loop is model-agnostic. Evidence and attacker subagents are cheap-model-friendly; keep the main thread (deciding, editing) on the strongest model available, and give attackers higher effort than gatherers when a choice exists.

## Loop safety (3.0)

Budgets (turns/minutes/tokens/money), repeat-fingerprint stop criterion, retry policy by error class — full version lives in the `loop` skill (Progress detector & retry policy). Expensive ops (judge, deep research) not every turn; user confirmation for irreversible/outward actions even inside the loop.
