# Git — Standardized Git Operations

## Commit Conventions

Use conventional commits: `type(scope): description`

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `feat` | New feature |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `style` | Formatting/style (no logic) |
| `refactor` | Code refactor (no feature/fix) |
| `perf` | Performance improvement |
| `test` | Add/update tests |
| `build` | Build system/dependencies |
| `ci` | CI/config changes |
| `chore` | Maintenance/misc |
| `revert` | Revert commit |

### Breaking changes
```
feat!: remove deprecated endpoint
```
```
BREAKING CHANGE: `extends` key behavior changed
```

## Branch Naming
- `feature/<name>` — new features
- `fix/<name>` — bug fixes
- `refactor/<name>` — refactoring
- `chore/<name>` — maintenance

## Workflow Rules
1. **Commit always, commit often.** Every meaningful change gets an immediate local commit. DO NOT wait for permission.
2. Always check `git status` and `git diff` before committing.
3. Write meaningful commit messages in Russian or English.
4. Don't push without user confirmation (local commits only).
5. Use `git add -p` for partial staging when appropriate.
6. One logical change per commit.
7. Never commit secrets (.env, credentials.json, private keys).

### Repository scope — when the "don't commit without asking" rule applies

The host system-prompt rule *"do not commit or open a PR unless the user asks"* applies
**ONLY to external/shared repositories**: GitHub-bound, PR-bound, public, or shared
history, where a commit is a release action.

It does **NOT** apply to the main workspace directory (the Oper workspace / local
working repo). There, committing is the default reliability mechanism — commit
meaningful changes immediately, in small logical units, without waiting for approval.

- Main workspace / private local repo → commit by default, no permission needed.
- External / GitHub-bound / shared / PR-bound repo → explicit approval before
  committing; never push or open a PR without an explicit request.
- Destination unclear → treat as the local workspace unless evidence shows the change
  targets public/shared history.
- NEVER stage other people's or unrelated changes; avoid `git add -A`; stage only the
  files changed for the current task.

## Creating a Commit

### 1. Analyze Diff
```bash
# If files are staged
git diff --staged

# Working tree diff
git diff

# Check status
git status --porcelain
```

### 2. Stage Files
```bash
# Specific files
git add path/to/file1 path/to/file2

# By pattern
git add *.test.*
```

### 3. Execute Commit
```bash
# Single line
git commit -m "<type>[scope]: <description>"

# Multi-line with body/footer
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
<type>[scope]: <description>

<optional body>

<optional footer>
EOF
)"
```

Always end with:
```

## Useful Commands
```bash
# Interactive add
git add -p

# Pretty log
git log --oneline --graph --all --decorate

# Undo last commit (keep changes)
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

## Safety
- NEVER update git config
- NEVER run destructive commands (--force, hard reset) without explicit request
- NEVER skip hooks (--no-verify) unless user asks
- NEVER force push to main/master
- If commit fails due to hooks, fix and create NEW commit (don't amend)
