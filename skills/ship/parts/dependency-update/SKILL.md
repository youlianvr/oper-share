# Dependency Update


## Invocation

Explicit-only with a defined dependency scope.


## Non-goals

- No inferred “update everything”.

- No publish/release.


## Workflow

1. Identify the dependency set and current versions.

2. Read release notes/changelogs.

3. Apply updates and fix breakages.

4. Verify with the project’s test/build gates.
