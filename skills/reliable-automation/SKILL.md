# Reliable Automation — 4 patterns

> Patterns extracted from auto-registration analysis and generalized. The value is in
> reproducibility, not in the tool itself (mass registration = ToS abuse, we don't do that).

## 1. Mailbox pool — swappable source of verification codes

**Essence:** verification codes come from different places (REST API, IMAP, MS Graph).
The registrar/flow should not know where from — only the interface.

**When to apply:** any service with email verification, temp-mail testing, recovery access,
bypassing one-time limits.

```python
class VerificationMailbox(Protocol):
    def wait_for_code(self, timeout: int = 180, interval: int = 3) -> str | None: ...

class MailboxSource(Protocol):
    def create_mailbox(self) -> VerificationMailbox: ...
```

**Implementations:**
- **REST API** (DuckMail-style): `POST /create` with Bearer → get address → poll
  `GET /messages` or `/code` with interval, timeout ~180s.
- **IMAP** (`outlook.office365.com:993`, port 993): login by email+password,
  scan incoming messages across fallback folders (INBOX + 3–4 spares), parse code with regex.
- **MS Graph**: refresh_token → access_token → `GET /v1.0/me/messages`, depth at least 15.

**Gotchas:**
- Account file format: delimiter `----`, NOT `|` — refresh token can contain `|`.
  `email----password----clientId----refreshToken----imap/graph/auto`
- Token could expire — on error from MS return a clear cause
  ("refresh token expired"), not a bare 401.
- Polling — always with interval and total timeout, not sleep at fixture time.

## 2. OAuth device flow instead of PKCE loopback (RFC 8628)

**Essence:** environment without a stable callback port (CLI, headless, console) —
not PKCE, but device flow: `device/code` → user authorizes on a page →
we poll the token endpoint.

**When to apply:** CLI clients, scripts, services without a public URL.

```python
import time, requests

ISS = "https://auth.example.com"
CID = "client_id_here"
SCOPE = "openid profile email offline_access api:access"

discovery = requests.get(f"{ISS}/.well-known/openid-configuration").json()
dev = requests.post(discovery["device_authorization_endpoint"],
                    data={"client_id": CID, "scope": SCOPE}).json()
# → to user: open dev["verification_uri_complete"] in browser
deadline = time.time() + dev.get("expires_in", 1800)
interval = max(dev.get("interval", 5), 1)
while time.time() < deadline:
    time.sleep(interval)
    r = requests.post(discovery["token_endpoint"], data={
        "grant_type": "urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code",
        "device_code": dev["device_code"], "client_id": CID})
    if r.status_code == 200:
        tok = r.json()  # access_token, refresh_token, id_token
        break
    # else: authorization_pending / slow_down / expired — handle by code
```

**Gotchas:**
- Polling with bounded retries: transport limit (3 consecutive empty errors — stop),
  time limit (30 min), don't loop on `slow_down` without increasing interval.
- If consent page requires submit — with real mouse events:
  `form.requestSubmit()` can give `Invalid action` (button has no `action`).
- Validate endpoints from discovery: only https and trusted host, otherwise fallback.

**Ready module:** `_scripts/oauth_device_flow.py` — working RFC 8628 implementation
(discovery GET + host validation, bounded-retry polling, slow_down, refresh,
CLI and library). Verified with live discovery from auth.x.ai. For xAI/Grok:
client_id `b1a00492-073a-47ea-816f-4c329264a828`, scope `openid profile email offline_access`,
issuer `https://auth.x.ai`.

## 3. Anti-detection browser automation techniques

**Essence:** bots get caught by small fingerprints: click coordinates, shared profiles,
repeating IPs, logs with real data.

**When to apply:** browser automation against captcha/anti-fraud
(DrissionPage, Playwright, CDP).

- **Click coordinates.** CDP emulation gives `screenX/screenY = 0` — this is detected.
  Patch getters in emulation:
  ```js
  (function(){
    Object.defineProperty(MouseEvent.prototype, 'screenX', {
      configurable: true, get(){ return 800 + Math.floor(Math.random()*400); } });
    Object.defineProperty(MouseEvent.prototype, 'screenY', {
      configurable: true, get(){ return 400 + Math.floor(Math.random()*300); } });
  })();
  ```
  Load this script before the page loads.
- **Profile isolation.** Each run — fresh temp profile + `--incognito`.
  Never reuse user-data between "personalities".
- **Proxy rotation without reuse.** Pool of endpoints from file (HOST:PORT / http(s)://),
  each round — random unused, on retry — new. Don't return used ones in the same run.
- **Desensitize logs.** In logs — only masked proxies/tokens/emails.
- **Process management:** kill only own (PID + create_time), not
  `killall chrome`.

**Gotchas:** headless is unstable on Turnstile — visible browser is more reliable;
dismiss cookie banner BEFORE clicking on the form.

## 4. Bounded retries per stage

**Essence:** a flow of steps (click → wait → submit). An error in one stage
does NOT restart the entire flow — retry only that stage, with limits.

**When to apply:** any multi-step flow with external dependencies
(network, captcha, email, third-party APIs).

```python
STAGES = ("open_form", "click_signup", "wait_code", "confirm", "wait_session")

def run_flow(max_retries=3):
    for stage in STAGES:
        for attempt in range(1, max_retries + 1):
            try:
                STAGE_HANDLERS[stage]()
                break                    # stage passed → next
            except RetryableError as e:
                if attempt == max_retries:
                    raise FlowFailed(stage, e) from e
                time.sleep(2 ** attempt) # bounded backoff
```

**Rules:**
- Classify errors: retryable (network, captcha-glitch, "not ready") vs terminal
  (service refusal, invalid data) — terminal is not retried.
- Each stage has its own retry limit; total deadline on the entire flow.
- After stopping — clean up: close browser/session, don't leave background processes.
- Stages with names + overlay/progress logic, so you can see where it got stuck.
