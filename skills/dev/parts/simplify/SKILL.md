# Simplify


## When to use

Use after behavior is understood and the user wants clarity or less complexity.


## Non-goals

- Do not mix cleanup with speculative refactors that change behavior.

- Do not “simplify” by deleting necessary safety checks.


## Workflow

1. Confirm current behavior with tests or reproduction.

2. Reduce complexity in small, reviewable steps.

3. Keep behavior-preserving verification green.
