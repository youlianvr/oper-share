# Modular Scale Typography


## What Is a Modular Scale


A modular scale starts from a **base size** and multiplies or divides by a **ratio** to generate every size in the system.


```

size(n) = base × ratio^n

```


## Choosing a Ratio


| Ratio | Name | Feel | Good for |

|---|---|---|---|

| 1.067 | Minor Second | Very tight | Dense data UIs, dashboards |

| 1.125 | Major Second | Subtle | Long-form reading, editorial |

| 1.200 | Minor Third | Balanced | Most UI applications |

| 1.250 | Major Third | Clear hierarchy | Marketing, landing pages |

| 1.333 | Perfect Fourth | Strong contrast | Display, hero sections |

| 1.414 | Augmented Fourth | Dramatic | Portfolios, branding |

| 1.500 | Perfect Fifth | Very dramatic | Use sparingly |


**Default recommendation:** `1.25` (Major Third) — enough contrast between steps to feel intentional without being theatrical.


## Generating a Scale


> **Recover an existing scale, don't reverse-engineer it by hand (dembrandt engine, optional).** If a brand already has type on the web, `get_typography` returns the real font sizes, weights, and line-heights computed off the live DOM — infer the underlying ratio from those, then regularise it with the method below, instead of guessing which sizes were intended. See [`extract-design`](../extract-design/SKILL.md).


Starting from `base = 16px`, ratio `1.25`:


| Step | Formula | Value | Rounded | Role |

|---|---|---|---|---|

| -2 | 16 ÷ 1.25² | 10.24px | 10px | Caption, label-xs |

| -1 | 16 ÷ 1.25 | 12.80px | 13px | Label, small |

| 0 | 16 | 16px | 16px | Body (base) |

| +1 | 16 × 1.25 | 20px | 20px | Body-lg, lead |

| +2 | 16 × 1.25² | 25px | 25px | H4 |

| +3 | 16 × 1.25³ | 31.25px | 31px | H3 |

| +4 | 16 × 1.25⁴ | 39.06px | 39px | H2 |

| +5 | 16 × 1.25⁵ | 48.83px | 49px | H1 |

| +6 | 16 × 1.25⁶ | 61.04px | 61px | Display |


Round to whole pixels or rem — the ratio provides the intent, exact pixel rounding is fine.


## Design Tokens (CSS custom properties)


```css

:root {

  --text-xs:   0.625rem;  /* 10px  — caption */

  --text-sm:   0.813rem;  /* 13px  — label   */

  --text-base: 1rem;      /* 16px  — body    */

  --text-lg:   1.25rem;   /* 20px  — lead    */

  --text-xl:   1.563rem;  /* 25px  — h4      */

  --text-2xl:  1.938rem;  /* 31px  — h3      */

  --text-3xl:  2.438rem;  /* 39px  — h2      */

  --text-4xl:  3.063rem;  /* 49px  — h1      */

  --text-5xl:  3.813rem;  /* 61px  — display */

}

```


## Tailwind Config


```js

// tailwind.config.js

fontSize: {

  'xs':   ['0.625rem', { lineHeight: '1rem' }],

  'sm':   ['0.813rem', { lineHeight: '1.25rem' }],

  'base': ['1rem',     { lineHeight: '1.5rem' }],

  'lg':   ['1.25rem',  { lineHeight: '1.75rem' }],

  'xl':   ['1.563rem', { lineHeight: '2rem' }],

  '2xl':  ['1.938rem', { lineHeight: '2.25rem' }],

  '3xl':  ['2.438rem', { lineHeight: '2.5rem' }],

  '4xl':  ['3.063rem', { lineHeight: '1.1' }],

  '5xl':  ['3.813rem', { lineHeight: '1' }],

}

```


## Comparing Scale Intervals


The sequence `14px`, `16px`, `18px`, `24px`, `32px`, `48px` has uneven intervals: 14→16 is a smaller proportional jump than 32→48. A modular scale keeps the ratio between adjacent steps constant.


## Minimum Font Size


**Body text base: 16px minimum.** This is the browser default for good reason — it is the threshold below which reading comfort drops significantly, especially on screens.


- **16px** — standard body text, the default base

- **14px** — acceptable for secondary UI text (labels, captions, metadata) used sparingly

- **Below 14px** — do not use. Even at high DPI, sub-14px text fails WCAG contrast requirements for normal text and creates accessibility issues.


In the modular scale, this means the base (`step 0`) should be 16px, and negative steps (step -1, step -2) should be used only for genuinely secondary content — never for body copy or primary labels.


**The 1% heuristic.** Sub-16px text is the rare exception (target: under ~1% of a page, never below 14px). Nobody counts characters, so apply it as a role test:


- **May go below 16px** — a fixed whitelist of glanced-at roles: timestamps, captions, table metadata, helper text, fine print, badge labels.

- **Never** — body copy, primary labels, list item titles, anything actually read to do the task.


Check: scan one screen, count distinct sub-16px roles. Two or three from the whitelist is healthy; five or more — or any reading content — means you've over-shrunk. That's layout density, not a type problem: cut what's shown rather than shrink the type to fit.


## Type Rendering Details


Size and ratio set the structure; these details determine whether the type actually reads well on screen.


### Letter Spacing

- **Body and default text:** keep tracking at `0`. Adding it to running text slows reading and makes the type feel loose.

- **Uppercase and small labels:** the one place tracking helps, since capitals are visually tight. Cap it at `0.04em`, and reach for that only when the label genuinely needs air.

- Pattern: **zero on lowercase body, at most a hair (`≤ 0.04em`) on uppercase labels** — never a blanket value. Over-tracking reads as dated, not premium.


### Weight on Dark Backgrounds

Light text on dark appears optically **thinner** — a halation effect where bright type bleeds into the dark field. Step up one weight to compensate: where regular (400) works on light, use **medium or semibold for the equivalent text on dark**. This keeps perceived weight consistent across modes instead of dark-mode text looking frail.


### Monospace

Monospace is for technical content where character alignment matters — code, IDs, numeric tables, diffs. **Don't use it as a default UI typeface, and avoid monospace + uppercase** (even widths plus tall capitals are hard to scan).


## Type Scale by Page Context


**Landing pages and marketing surfaces** benefit from large, expressive type — steps +4 to +6 for headlines create drama and brand presence.


**Feature pages and application UI** should use a more controlled range — steps +2 to +3 for headings, with body text at step 0. Oversized headings inside a functional UI distract from the content and make the layout feel unbalanced.


Match the ratio and scale usage to the purpose of the surface, not just the brand.


## Heading Hierarchy and Page Complexity


A successful heading scale uses more than just font size to distinguish levels. It also respects the cognitive limits of the page.


### Tools for Differentiation

If headings only differ by small increments of size, they become hard to distinguish at a glance. Use these tools to create a more meaningful scale:

- **Capitalization:** Use uppercase (`text-transform: uppercase`) for small, lower-level headings (H4–H5) to give them visual weight without needing large sizes.

- **Letter Spacing:** When using uppercase or bold headings, add at most a hair of `letter-spacing` (`≤ 0.04em`) — and only when the heading genuinely needs the air. Keep it subtle; over-tracking reads as dated, not premium.

- **Color:** Use your brand primary colour or a slightly muted grey for secondary headings to differentiate them from the main black/dark-grey text.

- **Style:** Use italics or subtle underlines for supplementary or metadata-style headings.


### The Rule of Three (H1–H3)

Most well-designed pages require only **three levels of heading hierarchy (H1, H2, H3)**.

- **Simplicity:** H1–H3 is enough to cover the page title, section titles, and sub-sections.

- **H4–H6 is a complexity smell, not a typography problem.** If you find yourself reaching for H4, H5, or H6, the page is trying to do too much. Adding smaller heading levels only hides the symptom. Read it as a signal and make a *structural* decision instead:

  - **Split** — the page is really two features, or an in-page sub-page. Break it across pages or a modular structure (sidebar, tabs, master-detail).

  - **Remove** — the deep section may not earn its place at all.

  - **Simplify** — flatten the sub-hierarchy so it fits within H1–H3.

  - **Hide behind an opening/closing element** — push secondary content into a modal, accordion, or panel (see `information-architecture`).


A page that needs 6 levels of headings is a page that most users will stop reading.


## Reading Comfort and Editorial Patterns


Typography is not just about size — it is about the rhythm and structure of the content.


### Line Length (Measure)

For optimal reading comfort, keep body text between **45–75 characters per line** (approx. 500–700px).

- Lines that are too long make it hard for the eye to find the start of the next line.

- Lines that are too short break the reading rhythm and create distracting "rags."


### Measure, Leading and Size Move Together

Line length, line-height (leading) and font size are not three independent knobs — they are one system. This is a foundational typographic principle (Bringhurst's *The Elements of Typographic Style*) repeatedly validated on digital platforms, and it underpins the line-height ramps in the Material and Apple HIG type scales.


**The longer the measure, the more leading the eye needs** to track from the end of one line back to the start of the next. A tight line-height that reads fine on a narrow column becomes tiring on a wide one.


| Measure | Recommended body line-height |

|---|---|

| Narrow (~45ch) | 1.4 |

| Comfortable (55–66ch) | 1.5 |

| Wide (~75ch) | 1.6–1.7 |


Practical rules:

- **Body text:** line-height **1.4–1.7**, never below 1.4 for multi-line copy. WCAG SC 1.4.12 also requires text to stay readable when users override line-height to **at least 1.5**, so design with that headroom.

- **Headings:** large type needs *less* leading — tighten to **1.1–1.25** as size grows, or the lines drift apart and stop reading as one unit. Leading and size are inversely related.

- **Fix the cause, not the symptom:** if a line of body text feels hard to read, widen the leading *or* narrow the measure — don't just shrink the font. The three move together.


### Line Clamping

In grids, cards, or lists with unpredictable content lengths, clamp text to keep a consistent visual rhythm and equal-height cards. Limit descriptions to 2–3 lines so all cards in a row stay the same height.


**Multi-line clamp.** Pair the standard `line-clamp` with the `-webkit-` fallback — the legacy `-webkit-box` form is still required for full browser support, so keep both.

```css

.card-description {

  display: -webkit-box;

  -webkit-box-orient: vertical;

  -webkit-line-clamp: 3;

  line-clamp: 3;

  overflow: hidden;

}

```


**Single-line clamp.** For titles and labels that must never wrap, use the ellipsis pattern instead.

```css

.card-title {

  white-space: nowrap;

  overflow: hidden;

  text-overflow: ellipsis;

}

```


**Inside flex or grid.** Truncation silently fails when the item can't shrink below its content width. Add `min-width: 0` (or `min-inline-size: 0`) to the clamped child so it is allowed to narrow.


**Accessibility — never lose the content.** Clamping hides text *visually only*; the full string stays in the DOM and is read in full by screen readers, but a sighted user can no longer see it. Always give them a path to the rest:

- Provide a `title` attribute (or accessible tooltip) carrying the full text, or

- Link to a detail view / "Read more" where the complete content lives.


Never clamp text that the user *must* read to act (prices, errors, legal copy, primary instructions) — clamp only supporting descriptions where truncation is safe.


### Editorial Hierarchy

Use specific typographic roles to provide context and guide the user through the story:


| Role | Visual Treatment | Purpose |

|---|---|---|

| **Pre-title (Eyebrow)** | Small (12–13px), often all-caps, subtle letter-spacing (`≤ 0.04em`), muted colour | Provides context or category without distracting from the main heading |

| **Heading** | Large, bold, modular scale step +3 to +5 | The primary hook or subject |

| **Ingress (Lead text)** | Larger than body (step +1), slightly bolder or higher line-height | Summarises the core value; bridging the heading and the body copy |

| **Body** | Base size (16px), regular weight, comfortable line-height (1.5) | The primary reading experience |


### Wording and Voice

- **Use active voice.** "Get started" instead of "Getting started is easy."

- **Be punchy.** Use clear, descriptive labels that promise a result.

- **Consistency.** Use the same terms for the same actions throughout the product.


## Responsive Type Scale


The scale compresses on smaller viewports by **tightening the ratio**, not by manually overriding individual sizes. The floor (body, labels) stays stable — readability has a hard minimum. The ceiling (H1, display) shrinks significantly. Every heading level scales proportionally because the ratio changes; hierarchy stays internally coherent.


**Rule:** use a wider ratio on desktop (more drama), a tighter ratio on mobile (more restraint). The base stays the same. The top end gives way.


- Desktop → wider ratio (e.g. 1.25–1.333): large contrast between H1 and body

- Tablet → moderate ratio (e.g. 1.200): scale pulls in

- Mobile → tight ratio (e.g. 1.125): H1 is notably smaller, body is unchanged


Never shrink the scale from the bottom. Body text at 16px is already a floor — compression always comes from the top.


### Fluid Type with `clamp()`

Instead of stepping sizes at fixed breakpoints, let the top end scale smoothly between a floor and a ceiling using CSS `clamp(MIN, PREFERRED, MAX)`. The viewport-relative middle term does the scaling; the floor and ceiling stop it from ever getting too small or too large.

```css

:root {

  --text-body: 1rem;                         /* the floor stays fixed */

  --text-h1: clamp(2rem, 1.5rem + 3vw, 3.5rem);

}

```

- The `MIN` is the mobile size, the `MAX` is the desktop size — the same floor/ceiling thinking as the stepped scale, just interpolated.

- Apply `clamp()` to the **top of the scale** (headings, display). Keep body and labels at a fixed size — readability has a hard minimum, so the floor must not move.

- Include a `rem` term in the preferred value (e.g. `1.5rem + 3vw`, not `3vw` alone) so the text still responds to user zoom and root font-size — a pure `vw` value breaks zoom accessibility.


## Review Checklist


- [ ] Are all font sizes derived from a single base + ratio?

- [ ] Is the base size 16px or larger?

- [ ] Is 14px used only for secondary/metadata text, never for body copy?

- [ ] Is nothing below 14px used anywhere in the UI?

- [ ] Counting distinct sub-16px text roles on a screen, are there only a few (≤3) and all from the secondary whitelist — never reading content?

- [ ] Is body letter-spacing 0, with uppercase-label tracking capped at `0.04em` and used only when air is needed?

- [ ] Does light-on-dark text use a slightly heavier cut to compensate for halation?

- [ ] Is monospace scoped to technical content, never used as a default or with uppercase?

- [ ] Is there at least 3–4 distinct steps between body text and the largest heading?

- [ ] Are adjacent steps (e.g. body vs. label) different enough to be distinguishable at a glance?

- [ ] Are font size tokens named by role (`--text-body`, `--text-h1`) or step (`--text-base`, `--text-2xl`), not by raw pixel value?

- [ ] Does the chosen ratio suit the UI density? (tight ratio for data-heavy UIs, wider ratio for marketing)

- [ ] Is body text line length between 45–75 characters?

- [ ] Does body line-height scale with the measure (≈1.4 narrow → ≈1.6+ wide), staying ≥1.4 and leaving 1.5 override headroom for WCAG 1.4.12?

- [ ] Is heading leading tightened (≈1.1–1.25) as size grows, so large type still reads as one unit?

- [ ] Is line-clamping used to keep grid/card layouts consistent?

- [ ] Does clamped text keep a path to the full content (`title`/tooltip or detail view), and is must-read content never clamped?

- [ ] If fluid type (`clamp()`) is used, is it applied only to the top of the scale, with a `rem`-based preferred term so zoom still works?

- [ ] Are editorial roles like pre-titles and lead text used to improve scannability?

- [ ] Are headings differentiated by more than just size (e.g., color, case, spacing)?

- [ ] Is the heading hierarchy limited to H1–H3 per view where possible?


## Common Anti-Patterns


| Anti-pattern | Problem | Fix |

|---|---|---|

| Sizes like 14, 15, 16, 17px used side by side | Steps too small to read as distinct levels | Use at minimum a 1.125 ratio so each step is perceptible |

| Arbitrary sizes with no relationship (13, 18, 27, 36px) | No underlying logic — hierarchy feels accidental | Regenerate from a single base and ratio |

| Pixel values hard-coded in components instead of tokens | Scale changes require hunting through every file | Define once as CSS custom properties or design tokens |

| Same scale used for display headings and dense data tables | One ratio rarely serves both extremes well | Use a tighter ratio (1.125) for data, wider (1.25–1.333) for marketing contexts |

| Letter-spacing added to running body text | Loosens the type and slows reading | Keep body tracking at 0; add at most `0.04em` to uppercase labels when air is needed |

| Regular-weight white text on a dark background | Halation makes it look thin and frail | Step up one weight (medium/semibold) for light-on-dark text |

| Monospace as a default UI font, or monospace + uppercase | Hard to scan, reads as "unstyled" | Scope monospace to code/IDs/numeric data only |
