name: information-architecture

description: In large applications, information architecture determines whether users can find, understand, and act on data. Naming matters. The UI should mirror the data model and signal how data can be transformed. Dangerous or irreversible changes always require a confirm dialog. Use when designing navigation, naming entities, structuring large feature sets, or modelling data-driven UI.

# Information Architecture


Information architecture defines what exists, what it is called, and how it relates to everything else in applications such as multi-module SaaS, ERPs, analytics platforms, and marketplaces.

## Naming is Design


**Principles:**


- **Use the user's vocabulary, not the engineer's.** If users call it a "job", do not call it a `task_assignment`. If they call it a "client", do not surface `contact_entity`.

- **Be specific.** "Settings" is vague. "Account settings", "Workspace settings", "Notification preferences" tell the user exactly where they are.

- **Be consistent.** If it is called "Project" in the sidebar, it must be called "Project" in the breadcrumb, the page title, the confirmation dialog, and the API error message.

- **Distinguish similar things.** If the product has both "Users" and "Members", the distinction must be meaningful and consistently communicated.

- **Name actions by their effect.** "Archive" not "Hide". "Publish" not "Save to live". "Transfer ownership" not "Change user".


**Naming audit questions:**

- Would a new user understand this term without training?

- Is this name used consistently across every surface it appears?

- Does this name describe what the thing *does*, not how it is stored?


### Internal vocabulary is not customer vocabulary

The terms a company uses internally are frequently *not* the terms the customer should see. An internal casual shorthand ("the recon job", "a P2 ticket") is precise for the team but opaque to an outsider. When a term crosses from the internal build into the customer-facing app, translate it to **the customer's word, or a universally understood one** — never ship the internal shorthand by default.


- **Introduce as few new terms as possible — a hard ceiling of ~10 invented terms for the whole product, and fewer is always better.** Every new coined term is something the user must learn before they can act. Prefer terms so universal that the end user already knows them over anything you'd have to teach.

- **Placement tells half the story.** Where a feature sits — which section, which nav group, next to what — communicates as much as its label. A well-placed control needs less naming; a well-named control in the wrong place still confuses. Design the location and the name together.


### Label length: buttons are terse, titles continue the story

- **Buttons: 1 word, ideally — 2 is fine, 3 is the maximum.** A button is an action verb, not a sentence. "Save", "Publish", "Invite member".

- **Titles and headings carry the fuller explanation.** Let the surrounding title, section header, or helper text extend the narrative that the button can only hint at. The button says *what*; the title says *what this whole area is about*.

## Mental Model Follows Data Model


The UI should be a direct, legible expression of the underlying data model. Users build a mental model of the product by interacting with it — that mental model should match how the data actually works.


**Match entities to screens.** Each major data entity (Project, Invoice, User, Product) typically deserves its own list view and detail view. Do not collapse distinct entities into one screen because it seems simpler — users will be confused when one action affects something they did not see.


**Expose relationships.** If a Project contains Tasks, and Tasks belong to Users, the UI hierarchy should reflect this:


```

Projects

  └── Project: Website Redesign

        └── Tasks

              └── Task: Fix header  [Assigned to: Maria]

```


Breadcrumbs, parent labels, and contextual references ("3 tasks in this project") reinforce the data relationships visually.


**Show transformation paths.** The UI should make it clear how data moves through the system. A draft becomes published. An invoice moves from pending to paid. A user is promoted to admin. These state transitions should be visible:


- Status labels that show current state and available transitions

- Action buttons labelled with the transformation: "Publish", "Mark as paid", "Promote to admin"

- Timeline or history showing past transitions


**Signal the scope of actions.** Before a user commits to an action, they must understand what it will affect:


```

"Archive this project?"

This will also archive 47 tasks and remove it from all dashboards.

Team members will lose access immediately.

[Cancel]  [Archive project]

```

## Confirm Dialogs for Dangerous Actions


Any action that is irreversible, affects a wide scope, or causes data loss requires explicit confirmation before execution.


**When a confirm dialog is required:**


| Action type | Example | Dialog required |

|---|---|---|

| Permanent deletion | Delete project, remove user | Always |

| Bulk destruction | Delete all items in a filter | Always |

| Irreversible state change | Publish, Submit, Send | Yes if no undo |

| Wide-scope change | Transfer ownership, change billing plan | Always |

| Account-level action | Cancel subscription, delete account | Always |

| Permission escalation | Grant admin access | Yes |


**Confirm dialog anatomy:**


```

[Title: specific, not generic]

"Delete project: Website Redesign?"


[Body: scope and consequences]

"This will permanently delete:

• 47 tasks

• 3 milestones

• All associated files


This cannot be undone."


[Secondary action]  [Destructive primary action]

    [Cancel]              [Delete project]

```


**Rules:**

- Title names the specific entity — "Delete project: Website Redesign?" not "Are you sure?"

- Body states exactly what will be affected and whether it can be undone

- The destructive action is labelled with the action, not "OK" or "Yes"

- The destructive action is visually distinct: red fill, or positioned on the right

- Cancel is always available and is the default focus (keyboard enter should not trigger deletion)

- For the highest-risk actions (account deletion, irreversible bulk operations), require the user to type the entity name to confirm


**What not to use a confirm dialog for:**

- Saving or updating (autosave + undo is better)

- Navigation away from unsaved changes (use an unsaved changes warning banner instead)

- Low-stakes reversible actions (archiving with an unarchive option)

## Navigation Structure in Large Applications


Aim for no more than 3 levels of hierarchy in primary navigation. If the product requires more, introduce grouping and search rather than more levels.


**Group by user goal, not by product feature.** Users navigate to accomplish tasks. Group navigation items around what users want to do, not around how the backend is organised.


```

Bad:  Settings → Integrations → Webhooks → Event types

Good: Developer → Webhooks

```


**Progressive disclosure for power users.** Show the most-used sections in primary navigation. Secondary features live in settings, secondary nav, or are reached via search. Do not surface every feature at the top level.


**Global search as escape hatch.** In large applications, search reduces the navigation burden. Users who know what they want should never have to navigate through 4 levels to find it.


**Logo as Home.** The product logo should always be an interactive link leading back to the primary landing page or dashboard.


**Global Header Consistency.** In applications with deep hierarchy, keep the primary header and top-level navigation consistent across all views. Changing the global navigation based on the user's current depth disorients them and removes their easy path back to other content.


**Persistent context.** In deeply nested views, the user must always be able to answer: where am I, what does this belong to, and how do I get back?

- **Shallow hierarchy (1–2 layers):** Use a simple "← Back to [Parent]" link. Breadcrumbs (Home > Parent > Current) often add unnecessary visual noise for simple structures.

- **Deep hierarchy (3+ layers):** Use breadcrumbs to provide a clear map of the user's location and an easy path to any parent level.


Use parent labels and contextual headers to reinforce the current location.


## Hide, Don't Delete — but Don't Serve It Up Front Either


When a feature or control adds density but a subset of users still needs it, you have three moves, not two. The mistake is treating it as a binary of *show it* or *remove it*.


1. **Surface it** — primary, always-visible. Reserve this for the actions on the main user path.

2. **Remove it** — if a control isn't earning its space and nobody's flow depends on it, cut it. Fewer, clearer controls beat a complete-but-noisy surface.

3. **Hide behind an opening/closing element** — the middle path, and often the right one. Move secondary functionality into a modal, drawer, accordion, popover, or expandable panel: **discoverable but not immediately present.** The element stays one interaction away, so the default view stays calm.


**Deliberate friction is a feature.** Place the reveal at the flow step where the user needs it — don't pre-load every option. Same instinct as the H1–H3 discipline (see `modular-scale-typography`): when a view sprouts deeper hierarchy, push the secondary layer into an opening/closing element.


Choose the container by the content's weight: **accordion/expandable** for inline detail the user reads in place, **popover/drawer** for a short secondary task, **modal** for a focused sub-task or confirmation that must interrupt.

## Review Checklist


- [ ] Are entity names derived from user vocabulary, not system terminology?

- [ ] Is the same name used consistently across every surface (nav, breadcrumb, dialog, error)?

- [ ] Does the UI hierarchy reflect the data model hierarchy?

- [ ] Are data state transitions (draft → published, pending → paid) clearly visible and labelled?

- [ ] Does every action communicate its scope before the user commits?

- [ ] Do all irreversible or wide-scope actions have a confirm dialog?

- [ ] Does the confirm dialog name the specific entity and list consequences?

- [ ] Is the destructive action in the confirm dialog labelled with the action, not "OK"?

- [ ] Is Cancel the default focus in confirm dialogs?

- [ ] Is primary navigation grouped by user goal, not product feature?

- [ ] Is global search available for products with more than 3 navigation levels?

- [ ] Does the product logo link back to the landing page or primary dashboard?

- [ ] Is the primary header and global navigation consistent across all views, regardless of depth?

- [ ] Are back links used for shallow hierarchies (1–2 layers) and breadcrumbs for deep hierarchies (3+ layers)?
