description: UI density — how much information and how many features appear at once — should match the primary platform and user type. Desktop supports dense, feature-rich interfaces; mobile requires focused, reduced layouts. Enterprise power users tolerate higher density than occasional users. Use when designing data tables, dashboards, toolbars, or adapting a desktop product for mobile.

# UI Density


Density describes how much information and how many interactive elements appear in a given area. The right density is not a universal standard — it depends on platform, user type, and session context.


## Platform Defaults


| Platform | Default density | Reason |

|---|---|---|

| Desktop | Medium to high | Large screen, precise input, often primary work surface |

| Tablet | Medium | Touch input, larger than phone but less than desktop |

| Mobile | Low | Small screen, touch targets need space, interrupted sessions |


Never port a dense desktop layout directly to mobile. Remove, collapse, or deprioritise features rather than shrinking them.


## User Type and Density


| User type | Appropriate density | Examples |

|---|---|---|

| Power user / enterprise | High density acceptable | Trading platforms, ERP, analytics, developer tools |

| Occasional / general user | Medium — clear visual breathing room | SaaS dashboards, project management |

| Consumer / first-time user | Low — guided, uncluttered | Onboarding flows, consumer apps, e-commerce |


A trading platform operator sits in the product for 8 hours a day and has learned every pixel — high density serves them. A user visiting a settings page once a month needs clear space and obvious labels.


Domain experts can use dense interfaces when these two conditions hold:


- **Terminology matches their vocabulary.** The labels, abbreviations, and jargon are the ones they already use. A term that's opaque to a consumer is a precise, fast signal to an expert — don't dumb it down for an audience that isn't there.

- **The outcome stays quickly reachable.** Density is fine as long as the *result* — the answer they came for, or the action they need — is fast to see or do, typically through an obvious **primary action** (see [[visual-emphasis-and-hierarchy]]).


Design a **power-user mode** around this: high density, expert terminology, keyboard-driven, primary action always in reach — distinct from a **casual/first-time mode** that guides and unclutters. The same product may offer both; match the mode to who is actually using the view.


## Density Tokens


Define spacing scale with density in mind. A compact variant reduces padding without changing structure:


```css

/* Default density */

--density-row-height:    44px;

--density-cell-padding:  var(--space-3) var(--space-4);

--density-gap:           var(--space-4);


/* Compact (enterprise / data-heavy) */

[data-density="compact"] {

  --density-row-height:    32px;

  --density-cell-padding:  var(--space-2) var(--space-3);

  --density-gap:           var(--space-2);

}


/* Spacious (consumer / onboarding) */

[data-density="spacious"] {

  --density-row-height:    56px;

  --density-cell-padding:  var(--space-4) var(--space-6);

  --density-gap:           var(--space-6);

}

```


## Feature Count by Platform


Not every feature belongs on every platform. For each feature ask: does a mobile user need this right now?


| Priority | Mobile | Tablet | Desktop |

|---|---|---|---|

| Core task | Always | Always | Always |

| Secondary actions | Collapsed (menu/sheet) | Visible | Visible |

| Filters and sorting | Accessible but not persistent | Collapsible | Persistent sidebar or toolbar |

| Bulk actions | Hidden or minimal | Reduced | Full |

| Advanced settings | Link to separate screen | Link or panel | Inline or panel |

| Data visualisation | Simplified (key metric only) | Reduced chart | Full chart |


## Density and Feature Reduction on Mobile


Sections and features can be removed, collapsed, or repositioned on smaller viewports — not just resized.


- **Remove:** Decorative sidebars, secondary data columns, promotional banners

- **Collapse:** Filters, advanced options, secondary navigation into accordions or bottom sheets

- **Reposition:** Toolbars move from top to bottom (thumb reach), sidebars move to drawers

- **Simplify:** A multi-column data table becomes a card list; a full chart becomes a single key metric


Progressive disclosure is the principle: show the minimum needed to complete the primary task, reveal more on demand.


## Reading Is Time


Reduce how much text the user must read to orient themselves and act:


- **Cut words before you shrink them.** The fix for a cramped screen is usually less content, not smaller type (see [[modular-scale-typography]]).

- **Let recognisable icons replace reading** where a concept has an unambiguous, standard icon — the eye recognises a shape faster than it reads a word (see [[brand-visual-language]]).

- **But don't over-ice with icons.** A wrong or decorative icon adds a thing to interpret instead of removing one; and an icon on everything is its own noise. Right icon, relevant place only.

- **Front-load the scannable bit.** Put the word or number the user scans for at the start of the line/label, so they don't read the whole thing to find it.


The goal: a user should be able to *glance*, not *read*, to know where they are and what to do next.


## Review Checklist


- [ ] Is the density appropriate for the primary platform (desktop = can be denser, mobile = must be sparse)?

- [ ] Is the density appropriate for the user type (power user = higher density, consumer = more space)?

- [ ] Are spacing tokens used to define density — not one-off padding values?

- [ ] On mobile: are secondary features collapsed, repositioned, or removed rather than shrunk?

- [ ] Are touch targets ≥ 44×44px even in compact density variants?

- [ ] Is a density toggle offered for enterprise tools where users have strong personal preferences?
